        <p>This is a mobile game I made completely by myself in unity with C#, <br>
            itâ€™s a 2D endless runner <br>
            It includes everything u need, homescreen, background music etc. <br>
            And of course it works on a mobile phone <br>
            I chose to use simple shapes to not make It to complicated <br>
            and give it a simple but fun look <br>
            Its horror themed so when u play the game it has al sorts of spooky sounds <br>
            The main thing I learned from this assignment <br>
            is making use of the UI buttons <br>
            and how to make them work on a mobile device <br>
            furthermore I just improved my basic C# skills
