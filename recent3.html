        <p>This is a Pong game I made together with my teacher <br>
            when I just started my study on this school <br>
            Its a very basic game that consists of <br>
            only a homescreen and 3 gamemodes <br>
            one of them is just classic pong against the cpu <br>
            another is 1v1 and the last one is 2v2 <br>
            The main thing I learned from this assignment <br>
            is just getting used to C# and unity <br>
