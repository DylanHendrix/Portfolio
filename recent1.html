        <p>This is a game I made completely by myself <br>
            with C# with unity in the second semester of previous schoolyear, <br>
            the assignment was to create something of what your ambition is. <br>
            For me its building games, <br>
            so I started to think about what kind of game I wanted to build, <br>
            I didn’t have that much time so kept it simple and made a 2D endless runner. <br>
            The game is fully complete so it includes a home screen, background music etc. <br>
            I also made the visuals of the player myself. <br>
            I learned that the most important thing when building a game <br>
            is to always have a good planning <br>
            for everything you want to do when you have limited time <br>
            because fast enough I discovered <br>
            that I had to do a lot of things in the small amount of time I had <br>
            because I didn’t have a good planning
